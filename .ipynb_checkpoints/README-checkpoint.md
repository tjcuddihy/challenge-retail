# The retail challenge

You have a file `Retail.csv` describing sales data for a hypothetical Camping Supplies store.
Using your tool of choice, answer the following questions:

1. Construct a report breaking down sales by country, sales channel, product and year. The report should be easy to navigate.

2. Provide a list of recommendations for improving the store's profit.

3. Predict the next year of sales for each country. Your predictions will be analysed by a statistically sophisticated manager.

4. What additional data would you want to collect? What analyses would it empower you to run?
